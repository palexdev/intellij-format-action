# IntelliJ IDEA Format Action
This action automatically formats your code using the IntelliJ formatter, ensuring it adheres to good style guidelines.

## Examples
This workflow will format all files that are supported by the formatter in your repository and commit the changes whenever there's a push to the `main` branch.
```yaml
name: IntelliJ Format

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  formatting:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: notdevcody/intellij-format-action@v1.1
```
---

This workflow will format all files that are supported by the formatter in your repository and commit the changes whenever there's a push to the `main` branch, including pull requests to it.
```yaml
name: IntelliJ Format

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  formatting:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - if: github.event_name != 'pull_request'
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}
      - uses: notdevcody/intellij-format-action@v1.1
```
